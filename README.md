# Modern UCI Doc
An attempt to rewrite the [UCI Protocol Documentation](https://github.com/fsmosca/UCIChessEngineProtocol) in a better organized and more clearly explained way. 
The intent of this document is to faithfully represent the UCI protocol as it stands in a way that is easier to understand and search, not to actually change the protocol in any way.
If you believe the UCI protocol is any way misrepresented by this document, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
