# Modern UCI Doc
An attempt to rewrite the [UCI Protocol Documentation](https://github.com/fsmosca/UCIChessEngineProtocol) in a better organized and more clearly explained way. 
The intent of this document is to faithfully represent the UCI protocol as it stands in a way that is easier to understand and search, not to actually change the protocol in any way.
If you believe the UCI protocol is any way misrepresented by this document, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Prettiness Contributions
Additionally, while I am capable of writing basic HTML to make a more interactive and navigable document than the original text file, I am not much of an artist or web designer, I mostly do native application programming. If you think you can make the site pretty, without diminishing it's ability to be downloaded in it's entirety without losing anything (please avoid any complicated scripts), feel free to make (a) pull request(s) and/or get in contact with me to be added as a contributor.

## All contributions
Please add yourself as an author to any pages you contribute to
using a meta author tag. 
It is up to you how you want to name yourself within reason,
keep it PG, brief, and don't impersonate people intentionally, 
but I don't mind if you want to use a pseudonym or whatever.

Please also add yourself to the list of authors (currently length 1) in footer.html.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you agree to any pull requests you make to this site being subject to the same license as the rest of the site, once a license is decided upon.
