                <h3>Use</h3>
                <p>
                    The isready command should be sent after the GUI has sent commands that may require the engine to pause for some time,
                    or in order to check that the engine has not crashed.
                    <br>
                    The isready command must <i>always</i> be answered with the <a href="../engine/readyok">readyok</a> command as soon as the
                    engine is ready to recieve additional commands.
                </p>
