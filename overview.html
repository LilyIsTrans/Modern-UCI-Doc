        <h1>Startup procedure</h1>
        <p>The GUI (or other interface) must always start first. Engines are started by the GUI.</p>
        <aside>
            All communication between GUI and engine happen through the engine's standard input and output.
        </aside>
        <ol id="Startup Procedure">
            <li>The GUI starts an engine which implements the UCI protocol, capturing it's standard input and output.</li>
            <li>The GUI sends the <a href="commands/gui/uci.html">uci</a> command, indicating that the engine should operate in UCI mode.</li>
            <li>The engine must respond with the <a href="commands/engine/id.html">id</a> command to identify itself.</li>
            <li>
                The engine may, after the <a href="commands/engine/id.html">id</a> command,
                send one or more <a href="commands/engine/option.html">option</a> commands,
                defining any configuration options the engine may have in addition to those
                defined by the standard.
            </li>
            <li>
                The engine must then send the <a href="commands/engine/uciok.html">uciok</a> command, confirming that it is done
                sending <a href="commands/engine/option.html">option</a> commands and that it is configured in uci mode. If the 
                engine does not send the <a href="commands/engine/uciok.html">uciok</a> command within a reasonable amount of time,
                the GUI should forcibly terminate the engine process and assume that an error occured within the engine.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Normal operation</h1>
        <p>
            Once the startup procedure is complete, the UCI protocol has been initialized.
            For lack of a better term, I will refer to this initialized state as "normal operation".
        </p>
        <p>
            During normal operation, both the engine and the gui must be able to accept, process, and potentially 
            respond to commands from the other at all times, even when busy. This should likely be handled
            by using asynchronous threads separate from the main bulk of the program logic to handle communication,
            but the standard does not require any particular way to ensure commands are always processed immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
            The engine should never do anything without being told. It should not spend idle time pondering moves,
            it should only ponder when the GUI tells it to.
        </p>
        <p>
            What follows is a list of "interactions" or "conversations" that the engine and GUI might have.
            Any of these may be initiated at any time. For additional information on a specific individual
            command, simply click on that command anywhere in the page.
